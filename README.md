# Online Shoppers Purchase Intention Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether an online shopper will complete a purchase using classification models.

## Dataset
- Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset
- Features include browsing behaviour, page values, bounce rates, and traffic type.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Outcome
The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics and insights were drawn from customer behaviour patterns.

## Results & Key Insights
- Random Forest achieved the best overall performance among the models tested.
- User behaviour features such as BounceRates, ProductRelated, and PageValues showed strong relationships with purchase intention.
- Evaluation metrics showed clear differences between classification models.
